# YPDrawSignatureView

Simple class for capturing signatures.

## Swift 3

The class supports Swift 3.
This branch is not backwards compatible, please download the previous release if you can not support Swift 3. Legacy versions will not be updated anymore.

- Swift 3.0 will be supported
- Swift 2.3 will not be supported

## Usage

Add a new `UIView` where you want the signature capture field. Set its class to `YPDrawSignatureView`, and connect it to an `@IBOutlet` property in your `UIViewController`. For saving and clearing the signature, add two buttons to your view controller. Hook each button up to an `@IBAction` function.

With the view selected, choose the IB Attributes Inspector panel to set custom values, or set them in code where you initialize the signature view.

#### Methods

* `clear()`

This clears the view

* `getSignature()`

This returns the signature with the bounds of the view

* `getCroppedSignature()`

This returns the signature with the bounds of the signature

#### Properties

* `doesContainSignature: Bool`

This is a computed read-only property returning `true` if the view actually contains a signature

* `strokeWidth: CGFloat`

Sets the width of the signature stroke

* `strokeColor: UIColor`

Sets the UIColor of the signature stroke

* `signatureBackgroundColor: UIColor`

Sets the background UIColor of the view

* `circularDots: Bool`

When true taps will be rendered as perfect circles, when false it is a rough short horizontal line.

#### Optional Protocol Methods

* `startedDrawing()`

Notifies the delegate when someone starts a stroke in the view

* `finishedDrawing()`

Notifies the delegate when someone finishes a stroke in the view

#### Example Code

The following sample code checks if there is a signature in the view before getting it.

```
class MyViewController: UIViewController, YPSignatureDelegate {

    @IBOutlet weak var drawSignatureView: YPDrawSignatureView!

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        // Do any additional setup after loading the view, typically from a nib.
    
        drawSignatureView.delegate = self
    }

    @IBAction func save(sender: AnyObject) {
        // Checking if the view actually contains a signature
        if drawSignatureView.doesContainSignature {
            let img = drawSignatureView.getCroppedSignature()
            // Do something with img
        } else {
            // Alert the user or do something else
        }
    }

    @IBAction func clear(sender: AnyObject) {
        drawSignatureView.clear()
    }

    // MARK: - Optional delegate methods
    func startedDrawing() {
        // Do something when start drawing
    }

    func finishedDrawing() {
        // Do something else when finished drawing
    }
}
```
